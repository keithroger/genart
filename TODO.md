# TODO

## General
- Optimize algorithms for multithreading

## Blackhole
- revise algorithm so that dots start circling faster as they get into
the center

## Ripple
- Make work with matrix module
- Make dots last for a short amount of time
- Overlay another set of particles with circles with a pi/4 shift
- Have two sets of particles so that they can alternate at appearing
